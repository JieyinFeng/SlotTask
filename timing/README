This directory contains testing and final results of timing optimization for event related fMRI

want to get ISI1 and ISI2 in

1) slotstart + buton push ( modeled as 1s avg)
2) slotspin (ISI1)
--- catch trial stop here ---
3) result/reciept
4) ITI (ISI2)

PIPELINE

1) genStimsWithAfni.bash  -- generates many stims using make_random_timing.py 
          |                  tests with 3dDeconvolve and 1d_tool.py (cor_mat)
          |
          \- info.txt          -- table of experiment metrics varrying 
                                  over parameter and iteration
  

2) timingFromAfni.R       -- provides functions for analyzing 
                             and ultimately saving as mat file


PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS
 - optseq2, could not find how to set focb (first order counter balence) so spin necessarily follows start

 - fMRIoptimize.funcs.R (from D. Paulsen), 3dDeconvolve models HRF easier (e.g. dmBlock) than fmri.stimulus
   consitant with actual analysis
